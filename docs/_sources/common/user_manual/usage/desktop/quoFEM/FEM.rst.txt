FEM: Finite Element Method
==========================

The FEM panel will present users with a selection of FEM applications. Currently, there are two application available: OpenSees and FEAPpv. More FE platforms will be added in future versions to allow users to provide their own simulation application.
For the OpenSees and FEAPpv applications, the user is required to specify the FEM input file and a postprocess script. 
The purpose of the postprocessing script is to recover, from the output files generated by the FEM applications, the results for the :ref:`lblQUO_QOI`.

	Input for FEM panel 


	.. note:: 

	The purpose of the postprocessing script is to parse the output and then place in a files labelled **results.out** a single line with the values of the **QoI**. The line must contain the **QoI** in the order specified with a space between each output quantatity. An example is as shown below.
