Release Plans

The following features are planned to be developed for upcoming releases of |app|. We are actively working on the features in the next release. Farther development priorities may change depending on feedback from the community. If you have any suggestions, we encourage you to contribute and contact us through the SimCenter Forum.


February 2023
-------------
#. Use hazard quantization to select a set of ground motions that efficiently represent the seismic hazard in a grid (1.3.3.4) - Select ground motions and assign occurrence rates so that they collectively yield a hazard curve that is a good approximation of the theoretical hazard curves at each grid point. This method allows to run a reasonably small number of scenarios isntead of a comprehensive rupture forecast in a regional study.
#. Automatically access and assign demographic data from Census to assets (1.4.2.1) - Import census-block level demographic data from Census and assign it automatically to every asset in the inventory based on their location.


March 2023
----------
#. Water Distribution Network, buried pipelines.
   
Sept 2023
----------

#. Efficient forward propagation using Multi-Fidelity Monte-Carlo (1.2.3.1) - Use a few realizations of the output calculated with expensive, high-fidelity models to evaluate and correct the bias in efficient, approximate models, such as surrogates. With little extra computational demands, this method provides a substantial improvement in surrogate model performance if you have the high-fidelity models available that were used to train the surrogates.

#. Support transportation networks and provide corresponding Examples (1.3.4.7) - Extend the scope of tool with transportation networks and add examples that can serve as templates.

#. Add datasets to simulate subassembly damage and losses under wind demands (1.3.5.1) - Data from recent publications in the Performance-Based Wind Engineering literature is collected to enable high-resolution performance assessment under wind hazard.

#. Incorprate surrogate models created by other SimCenter tools in regional assesments (1.3.6.1) - Other tools can export models in a standard format that can be imported directly in R2D for use in regional simulations.   

#. Probabilistic asset inventories (1.3.6.2) - Calibrate, store, and propagate uncertainties in building features at the regional scale.

      
March 2024
----------
#. Automatic access to physics-based ground motion simulation results (1.1.1.3)

#. Add datasets to simulate subassembly damage and losses under water demands (1.3.5.2)

#. Add datasets to simulate high-resolution damages and losses in buried pipeline networks (1.3.5.4)
   

Sept 2024
---------
#. Develop methods to model interdependencies between physical components, housing, socio-economic functions, and lifelines (1.3.4.6)

#. Add datasets to simulate high-resolution damages and losses in transportation networks (1.3.5.3)

#. Develop and implement metrics and their visualization to inform recovery and community resilience (1.4.3.2)


Sept 2025
---------
#. Multi-fidelity models in regional simulations (1.3.3.1)
#. Multi-scale models for wind and water (1.3.3.2)
